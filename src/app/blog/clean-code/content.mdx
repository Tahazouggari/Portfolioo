## Remerciement

I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the members of IPLAB for their invaluable support and guidance during my research at NAIST. Special thanks to:

- **[Professor Youki Kadobayashi](https://iplab.naist.jp/members/youki/)** (Tuteur): For his exceptional mentorship and leadership.
- **[Dr. Yuzo Taenaka](https://taenaka.net/)** (Associate Professor): For his insightful advice and encouragement.

I would also like to extend my appreciation to the other members of IPLAB, whose collaboration and camaraderie made this experience truly enriching. I will add more names here as needed.

## About IPLAB

The Laboratory for Cyber Resilience (IPLAB) was established in January 2017 by **Professor Youki Kadobayashi**, succeeding Professor Yamaguchi’s Internet Engineering Laboratory. Its abbreviation, IPLAB, symbolizes the effort and spirit of the former laboratory’s professor. Initially part of the graduate school of information science, it transitioned into the information science division under the graduate school of science and technology at NAIST in April 2018.

### Research Focus

IPLAB engages in research and education to enhance cyber resilience against potential threats. The lab focuses on empirical studies to improve resilience (i.e., making systems secure, flexible, and efficient) in both cyber and physical domains. Additionally, transferring these technologies into real-world applications is a core emphasis.

Key research areas include:

- **Security**: Malware analysis, phishing, forensics, IoT security, and security standards.
- **Network**: DDoS mitigation, IPv6 transition, software-defined networks (SDN/NFV), wireless networks (WLAN/LPWA), and IoT.
- **Society**: Cybersecurity education, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (drone) security, and security standards.

### Education and Outreach

IPLAB organizes international workshops and laboratory sessions to share knowledge on specific topics. The lab also participates in educational projects for students, company employees, and professionals in various industries, such as:

- Hardening Project
- IT-Keys
- enPiT-Security

### Achievements

- **February 11, 2024**: Mr. Abraham Olufemi Abiodun, a third-year PhD student, received the SHIMADZU CORPORATION Award at the 2023 Doctoral Career Messe KYOTO.
- **November 11, 2023**: A student team won 1st place in the static analysis category and 2nd place in the DFIR category at MWS Cup 2023.
- **October 9, 2022**: The Hardening Project won Japan's Good Design Award 2022.
- **March 24, 2019**: The lab launched its new website.
