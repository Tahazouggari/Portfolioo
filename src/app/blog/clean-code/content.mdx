## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the members of IPLAB for their invaluable support and guidance during my research at NAIST. Special thanks to:

- **[Professor Youki Kadobayashi](https://iplab.naist.jp/members/youki/)** (Tuteur): For his exceptional mentorship and leadership.
- **[Dr. Yuzo Taenaka](https://taenaka.net/)** (Associate Professor): For his insightful advice and encouragement.

I would also like to extend my appreciation to the other members of IPLAB, whose collaboration and camaraderie made this experience truly enriching. I will add more names here as needed.

## About IPLAB

The Laboratory for Cyber Resilience have been established in January 2017 by Professor **Youki Kadobayashi**, succeeding Professor Yamaguchi’s Internet Engineering Laboratory. Its abbreviation, IPLab, was inherited as a symbol, effort and spirit of the former laboratory’s professor. When this laboratory was founded, it was a part of graduate school of information science which later transformed into information science division under the graduate school of science and technology, Nara Institute of Science and Technology in April 2018.

Our laboratory engages in research and education for cyber strength against possible threats. We focus on empirical studies for improving the resilience (i.e. making it secure, flexible and efficient) both over the cyber and physical areas. In addition to that, the transfer of those technology into the real world is also one of the core emphases. In the area of research, we are investigating on all technical domains of resilience as follows:

- **Security**: security standards, malware analysis, phishing, forensics, and Internet of Things (IoT).
- **Network**: DDoS, IPv6 transition, software networks (SDN/NFV), wireless networks (WLAN/LPWA) and IoT.
- **Society**: security standards, cyber security education, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (drone).

These aforementioned areas are only few examples of what we are interested in. With regards to education, we organise international workshops and laboratory workshops to learn and share some specific topics. Furthermore, we are involved in organising some educational projects for students, company employees and professionals in various industrial sectors, such as Hardening Project, IT-Keys, enPiT-Security, etc.

# Research Objectives

### Overview
I conducted research on malware detection using game theoretic frameworks at NAIST's IPLAB, developing innovative approaches to address evolving cybersecurity challenges. The project focused on modeling malware-detector interactions as strategic games, enabling more sophisticated defense mechanisms.
